# ðŸ“Š Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning models. The objective is to classify whether a customer will churn or not based on their subscription and usage details.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about Telco customers, including demographics, account details, and service usage. Key features include:

- `gender`
- `SeniorCitizen`
- `tenure`
- `MonthlyCharges`
- `TotalCharges`
- `HasInternetService`
- `Churn` (target variable)

---

## Project Highlights
- Loaded and inspected the dataset using **Python** and **Pandas**.
- Performed **data cleaning** and **preprocessing**, including handling missing values and converting categorical variables.
- Built multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluated models using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.
- Deployed the final model with **Streamlit** for real-time predictions through a web app interface.
